# Python Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to your first Python tutorial! In this program, we are going to use the NLTK library for Python, to create a semantic parse tree. We will be using GitHub to take some existing code, add to it, and then add it back to the "Repository".

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

 1. Python installed on your computer
 2. PyCharm
 3. Git installed
 4. A GitHub account

If you don't have any of these above, you can feel free to go to the [Resources](https://github.com/UF-CompLing/Resources/blob/master/Downloads.md) repository on the UF-Compling Github page.

## "Cloning" the repository

The first thing we will do is to move what's on the Github page into PyCharm. This is called Cloning. 

 * Fire up PyCharm
 * Click "Check out from Version Control"
 * A dropdown should appear, and then click GitHub
 * Input your GitHub username and password
 * Leave the Master Password area blank
 * Under Git Repository URL, input https://github.com/UF-CompLing/PythonTutorial.git
 * It will ask whether you want to open the directory. Click "Yes".

PyCharm's editor should open. It should look like....

## Run the program

First, we will open up the source code. 

* On the top, left side of the editor, you should see two folders: one labeled "PythonTutorial" and another labeled "External Libraries". 
* Double-click the PythonTutorial folder to open it. It should open up the files inside.
* Double-click the "tree.py" file. This should open up the source code on the main window.

To run it, Python needs to know which file to run. 

* Click the "Run" toolbar on the top of the screen, and then click "Run...."
* Press the "tree.py" file
* If the file hasn't run already, press the play button on the top right

On the bottom of the screen (the "console"), it should read this:
