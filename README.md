# Python Tutorial

## Introduction
Welcome to your first Python tutorial! In this program, we are going to use the NLTK library for Python, to create a semantic parse tree. We will be using GitHub to take some existing code, add to it, and then add it back to the "Repository".

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

 1. Python installed on your computer
 2. PyCharm
 3. Git installed
 4. A GitHub account

If you don't have any of these above, you can feel free to go to the [Resources](https://github.com/UF-CompLing/Resources/blob/master/Downloads.md) repository on the UF-Compling Github page.
